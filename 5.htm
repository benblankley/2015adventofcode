Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  You do risk spoiling a few
surprises for yourself, though.  Best to play the normal way and discover
everything as it was intended, I think.  The best surprises don't even appear
in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles probably took the longest; the easiest ones were around 45 minutes
each, but the harder ones took 2-3 hours, some even longer than that. A lot of
effort went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as
much as I enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This? ---</h2><p>Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.</p>
<p>A <em>nice string</em> is one with all of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains at least three vowels (<code>aeiou</code> only), like <code>aei</code>, <code>xazegov</code>, or <code title="John Madden John Madden John Madden">aeiouaeiouaeiou</code>.</li>
<li>It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like <code>xx</code>, <code>abcdde</code> (<code>dd</code>), or <code>aabbccdd</code> (<code>aa</code>, <code>bb</code>, <code>cc</code>, or <code>dd</code>).</li>
<li>It does <em>not</em> contain the strings <code>ab</code>, <code>cd</code>, <code>pq</code>, or <code>xy</code>, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ugknbfddgicrmopn</code> is nice because it has at least three vowels (<code>u...i...o...</code>), a double letter (<code>...dd...</code>), and none of the disallowed substrings.</li>
<li><code>aaa</code> is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.</li>
<li><code>jchzalrnumimnmhp</code> is naughty because it has no double letter.</li>
<li><code>haegwjzuvuyypxyu</code> is naughty because it contains the string <code>xy</code>.</li>
<li><code>dvszwmarrgswjxmb</code> is naughty because it contains only one vowel.</li>
</ul>
<p>How many strings are nice?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>238</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Realizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining whether a string is naughty or nice.  None of the old rules apply, as they are all clearly ridiculous.</p>
<p>Now, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping, like <code>xyxy</code> (<code>xy</code>) or <code>aabcdefgaa</code> (<code>aa</code>), but not like <code>aaa</code> (<code>aa</code>, but it overlaps).</li>
<li>It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them, like <code>xyx</code>, <code>abcdefeghi</code> (<code>efe</code>), or even <code>aaa</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>qjhvhtzxzqqjkmpb</code> is nice because is has a pair that appears twice (<code>qj</code>) and a letter that repeats with exactly one letter between them (<code>zxz</code>).</li>
<li><code>xxyxx</code> is nice because it has a pair that appears twice and a letter that repeats with one between, even though the letters used by each rule overlap.</li>
<li><code>uurcxstgmygtbstg</code> is naughty because it has a pair (<code>tg</code>) but no repeat with a single letter between them.</li>
<li><code>ieodomkazucvgmuy</code> is naughty because it has a repeating letter with one between (<code>odo</code>), but no pair that appears twice.</li>
</ul>
<p>How many strings are nice under these new rules?</p>
