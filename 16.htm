Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  You do risk spoiling a few
surprises for yourself, though.  Best to play the normal way and discover
everything as it was intended, I think.  The best surprises don't even appear
in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles probably took the longest; the easiest ones were around 45 minutes
each, but the harder ones took 2-3 hours, some even longer than that. A lot of
effort went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as
much as I enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---</h2><p>Your Aunt Sue has given you a wonderful gift, and you'd like to send her a thank you card.  However, there's a small problem: she signed it "From, Aunt Sue".</p>
<p>You have 500 Aunts named "Sue".</p>
<p>So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave you the gift.  You open the present and, as luck would have it, good ol' Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine!  Just what you wanted.  Or needed, as the case may be.</p>
<p>The My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM for short) can detect a few specific compounds in a given sample, as well as how many distinct kinds of those compounds there are. According to the instructions, these are what the MFCSAM can detect:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>children</code>, by human DNA age analysis.</li>
<li><code>cats</code>.  It doesn't differentiate individual breeds.</li>
<li>Several <span title="It can tell them apart by their distinct Dog Residue.">seemingly random breeds of dog</span>: <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoyed_%28dog%29">samoyeds</a></code>, <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeranian_%28dog%29">pomeranians</a></code>, <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita_%28dog%29">akitas</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizsla">vizslas</a></code>.</li>
<li><code>goldfish</code>.  No other kinds of fish.</li>
<li><code>trees</code>, all in one group.</li>
<li><code>cars</code>, presumably by exhaust or gasoline or something.</li>
<li><code>perfumes</code>, which is handy, since many of your Aunts Sue wear a few kinds.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these.  You put the wrapping from the gift into the MFCSAM.  It beeps inquisitively at you a few times and then prints out a message on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_tape">ticker tape</a>:</p>
<pre><code>children: 3
cats: 7
samoyeds: 2
pomeranians: 3
akitas: 0
vizslas: 0
goldfish: 5
trees: 3
cars: 2
perfumes: 1
</code></pre>
<p>You make a list of the things you can remember about each Aunt Sue.  Things missing from your list aren't zero - you simply don't remember the value.</p>
<p>What is the <em>number</em> of the Sue that got you the gift?</p>
