Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  You do risk spoiling a few
surprises for yourself, though.  Best to play the normal way and discover
everything as it was intended, I think.  The best surprises don't even appear
in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles probably took the longest; the easiest ones were around 45 minutes
each, but the harder ones took 2-3 hours, some even longer than that. A lot of
effort went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as
much as I enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 20: Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses ---</h2><p>To keep the Elves busy, Santa has them deliver some presents <span title="This was before the Elves unionized, apparently.">by hand, door-to-door</span>.  He sends them down a street with infinite houses numbered sequentially: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>Each Elf is assigned a number, too, and delivers presents to houses based on that number:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first Elf (number <code>1</code>) delivers presents to every house: <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, ....</li>
<li>The second Elf (number <code>2</code>) delivers presents to every second house: <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>8</code>, <code>10</code>, ....</li>
<li>Elf number <code>3</code> delivers presents to every third house: <code>3</code>, <code>6</code>, <code>9</code>, <code>12</code>, <code>15</code>, ....</li>
</ul>
<p>There are infinitely many Elves, numbered starting with <code>1</code>.  Each Elf delivers presents equal to <em>ten times</em> his or her number at each house.</p>
<p>So, the first nine houses on the street end up like this:</p>
<pre><code>House 1 got 10 presents.
House 2 got 30 presents.
House 3 got 40 presents.
House 4 got 70 presents.
House 5 got 60 presents.
House 6 got 120 presents.
House 7 got 80 presents.
House 8 got 150 presents.
House 9 got 130 presents.
</code></pre>
<p>The first house gets <code>10</code> presents: it is visited only by Elf <code>1</code>, which delivers <code>1 * 10 = 10</code> presents.  The fourth house gets <code>70</code> presents, because it is visited by Elves <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>4</code>, for a total of <code>10 + 20 + 40 = 70</code> presents.</p>
<p>What is the <em>lowest house number</em> of the house to get at least as many presents as the number in your puzzle input?</p>
